# Differential-Equations
Simulate and visualize n-dimensional particle motion in fields defined by arbitrary differential equations.

Features:
- Dynamic ODE system builder
- Numerical integration (solve_ivp)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- ML-based trajectory prediction (PyTorch)
- Animated visual comparison of real vs. predicted paths

## Run It
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
